# Accessiblity
- Design with high contrast
- Use `alt` text for images
- Links with more meaningful text than `Click Here`
- Using the right HTML component
  -  `<button>` vs `<div>`
  -  `<h1>` vs `<span>`
  -  `<label>` vs `<span>`
  -  Use `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>` tags
- Design for mouse / touch / keyboard usage 
  - Focus / hover styles 

<!--
- Some designers like shades of gray, low contrast
-->
